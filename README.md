# Skynyrd Overdrive Pedal

# About
The Skynyrd overdrive pedal is my attempt at bringing that sought-after southern rock Peavey Mace sound that Skynyrd used into any setup. Having drawn inspiration from tube screamers, my goal was to create a highly versatile pedal that can be used as a clean boost, solid drive into another drive pedal, or a standalone pedal that will add new tonal possibilites to your arsenal.
