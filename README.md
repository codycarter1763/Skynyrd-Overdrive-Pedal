# Skynyrd Overdrive Pedal

# About
The Skynyrd overdrive pedal is my attempt at bringing that sought-after southern rock Peavey Mace sound that Skynyrd used into any setup. Having drawn inspiration from tube screamers, my goal was to create a highly versatile pedal that can be used as a clean boost, solid drive into another drive pedal, or a standalone pedal that will add new tonal possibilites to your arsenal. 

# About Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Peavey Mace
Back when Lynyrd Skynyrd first got started, guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins used Marshall Super Lead Plexis for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird. Though, due to Skynyrd blowing Marshall amps from repeated usage at high volumes during touring, they opted for a more reliable amp. There comes Peavey and the Peavey Mace amp, known for it's high headroom, volume, and reliability.
